# TeaSpeak Egg for Pterodactyl
This is the current first attempt for a TeaSpeak Egg.
https://teaspeak.de

It currently downloads a fixed version of TeaSpeak via the install script (x64!!!) and unpacks it.
The start command gives the set port.
Ports for e.g. query port are not transmitted yet. Here the standard ports are used.
