<!--	For a detailed explanation of this three-pass access control system,
	see:  http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_access.html

	The first pass checks all Allow or Deny entries, as specified by the
	Order directive.  The second pass checks all Deny or Allow entries.
	The third pass applies to nations/zones which didn't match before.
	The last value in Order thus controls the default behavior when no
	match is found among Allow and Deny, and when both sections match.

	From values are case-sensitive, upper- and lowercase characters must
	match exactly with the players' nations/zones you want to control.

	Special From value 'all' matches all nations/zones, and can be used
	only once in either the Allow or Deny section, with no other From
	fields in that section.

	Examples of some common situations:

	1. On TMN allow only players from the Benelux:

		<order>Deny,Allow</order>
		<allow>
			<from>BEL</from>
			<from>NED</from>
			<from>LUX</from>
		</allow>
		<deny>
			<from>all</from>
		</deny>

	2. The same policy can also be configured like this (note that
	   because Deny is last, it cannot contain 'all' or the allowed
	   nations would be denied as yet):

		<order>Allow,Deny</order>
		<allow>
			<from>BEL</from>
			<from>NED</from>
			<from>LUX</from>
		</allow>
		<deny>
			<from></from>
		</deny>

	3. On TMF allow all players except from France and Great Britain:

		<order>Deny,Allow</order>
		<allow>
			<from></from>
		</allow>
		<deny>
			<from>France</from>
			<from>United Kingdom</from>
		</deny>

	And a more complex one:

	On TMF allow only players from Germany and Austria, except Berlin,
	Vienna, and the entire Bavaria region:

		<order>Allow,Deny</order>
		<allow>
			<from>Germany</from>
			<from>Austria</from>
		</allow>
		<deny>
			<from>Germany|Berlin</from>
			<from>Germany|Bavaria</from>
			<from>Austria|Vienna</from>
		</deny>

	Configure your server's access policies below:
-->
	<order>Deny,Allow</order>

	<allow>
		<from>all</from>
	</allow>

	<deny>
		<from></from>
	</deny>

	<messages>
		<denied>{#server}>> {#message}Player {#highlite}{1}$z$s{#message} denied access from {2} {#highlite}{3}{#message} [{#error}Kicked $z$s{#message}]</denied>
		<dialog>{#message}Access from zone {#highlite}{1} {#message}denied$z</dialog>
		<reload>{#server}> Player access control reloaded from {#highlite}access.xml</reload>
		<xmlerr>{#server}> {#highlite}access.xml {#error}config error, player access control disabled!</xmlerr>
		<missing>{#server}> {#error}Missing parameter, use {#highlite}$i /admin access help {#error}!</missing>
	</messages>
</access>
